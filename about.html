                Welcome! This citizen science web tool is designed to enable landowners in South Carolina 
                to report sightings of endangered or invasive species on their property with the purpose of providing 
                valuable data to environmental agencies and the public. 

                More than 90 percent of land in South Carolina is privately owned; therefore, state agencies such as the DNR, 
                are unable to consistently monitor invasive and endangered species populations on these lands. Early detection of 
                an endangered or invasive species could determine whether eradication or successful management is possible, which 
                is why this interactive web application was developed. This tool may assist state agencies in their monitoring 
                efforts through citizen science and provide valuable data about the presence and potential frequency of these species. 
                This tool could also be useful for landowners who are interested in the sightings/reports of endangered and invasive 
                species near them. For example, the highly destructive wild boar (invasive species) in South Carolina is a serious 
                threat to agriculture and so understanding their distribution is important for managing their population and mitigating 
                potential damages.<br>
                <br>
                This project was created by Lauren Martucci for the course, Geography 778, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
                in the summer of 2022. This web application is not an authoritative source on endangered or invasive species in South Carolina.

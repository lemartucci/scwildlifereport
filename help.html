      <p>Welcome! This citizen science web tool is designed to enable landowners in South Carolina to report sightings of endangered or invasive species on their property with the purpose of providing valuable data to environmental agencies about the presence and spread of these species.
        <br>
        <br>
        With this tool, users may pan and zoom on the map of South Carolina, click on points that are present on the map to retrieve sighting information, create reports of their own with the option of uploading a photo, and download report data through ArcGIS Online. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Resources regarding species identification, management, and prevention are located under the “Resources” tab and are listed at the bottom of this web page. For additional help in using this tool, navigate to the “Help” tab; to report an issue use the “Report an Issue” link at the bottom of the web page.
